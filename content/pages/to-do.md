There's a lot I want to learn, and a lot I've learned and documented. Here's where I list both.

## To Write About

My current focus is **Computer Science** fundamentals and all things **JavaScript**.

## JavaScript

### _JavaScript Fundamentals_

- [ ] Variables
- [ ] Data Types
- [ ] Operators
- [ ] Comparisions
- [ ] Interaction: alert, prompt, confirm
- [ ] Conditional Operator: if, '?'
- [ ] Logical Operator
- [ ] Loops
- [ ] Switch Statement
- [ ] Functions
- [ ] Function expressions and arrows

### _Objects: the basic_

- [ ] Objects
- [ ] Object method, `this`
- [ ] Constructor, operator `new`

### _Data Types_

- [ ] Method of primitives
- [ ] Numbers
- [ ] Strings
- [ ] Arrays
- [ ] Array methods
- [ ] Iterables
- [ ] Map, Set, WeakMap and WeakSet
- [ ] Object.keys, values, entries
- [ ] Destructuring assignment
- [ ] Date and time
- [ ] JSON methods, toJSON

### _Advanced working with functions_

- [ ] Recursion and Stack
- [ ] Rest parameters and spread operator
- [ ] Closure
- [ ] The old `var`
- [ ] Global Object
